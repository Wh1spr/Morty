# The Big Todo List
Basically everything I want to do for the bot, mostly features, overhauls, redos...

1. Make a logger. Log every event when it occurs, except messages of course. I mean kicks, bans, things that morty does (like adding a user to the database, updating the database, changing his name,...)

2. Make things more general, so Morty can be used in other servers easily. Database will expand because of this, mostly just guildId that's extra.

3. Make a useful `.help` command.

4. Make the current commands more elegant.

5. Redo the database, so it's easier to manipulate and obtain data from. (make the Database type instanced probably)

6. Redo permissions, again for more general use of Morty.
